Hello, you can call me Loading! Any pronouns are fine :)

This profile is intended to host little fun projects I'm working on. 
I want to be a better programmer, 
and more importantly get better at expressing myself through code and maths. 
I identify with the things I learned in my degree 
in a manner I find hard to express in words.
I hope this endeavor helps to close that gap.

The goal is to do some kind of work here every day.
I will write some code that makes something here that wasn't here the day before.
Then I will share evidence of that... somehow.

My comfort language is matlab, so I'll be starting there.
But I intend to branch out in time.
