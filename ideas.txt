A list of ideas to myself for things to make in the future.
I need an idea stockpile
To make a project stockpile
To continue daily output
To open myself.

In the future it may behoove me
To make this list private.
At present I see no reason to do this
And fortunately I will see this list every day as I am tinkering with stuff.

==== SWARMALATORS ====
I've always had a soft spot for these funky guys!
[] Swarmalator simulation
[] Write numerical scheme
[] Add voronoi cells
[] Extend to 3D?
[] Sim on different topologies, e.g. donut

==== ORCHARDS ====

The above video has rattled around in my head for years.
[] Animate visual regions between circular orchards
[] Align orchards on different lattices
[] Be able to move them around, dilate and contract in diameter
[] Fun topologies?

==== PROJECTIVE HARWOOD ====
There is a June Harwood painting that stuck with me today.
It doesn't look like a perfectly projected hexagonal lattice
Because it was made by a human.
My partner suggest that shape could be wrapped on a dome.
Makes me wonder what actual 3D geometries could create the visuals on the canvas.
[] Make linear algebra projective visual thing - dragging corners like a "PDF scanner" phone app
[] Make hexagonal lattice
[] Warp it on 3D shape
[] Attempt the inverse problem

==== BLUE SKY CATASTROPHE ====
This thing is so fucking well named
And I really like bifurcations
But I've never actually seen one happen. Only looked at figures.
It's time to change that.
[] ODE numerical scheme solver
[] Find bifurcation values
[] Make fun animation. Profit spiritually.

==== LOADING ====
In many ways I am loading.
I want to represent that artistically.
[] Loading bars running around Lorenz attractor
[] Several nearby initial starting points. Watch as loaders diverge. This is a rich statement on the human experience.
